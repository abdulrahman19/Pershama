# Summaries:
I'll collect all my summaries here to remember things later. And also train myself to write MD syntax.

## Index
> If you find a link in the episode title that means there are some explanations in there, otherwise the episode summary you will find them in the code, you can use `History` tab on the Github or `git log -- path/to/folder-name` on your local to know what happened specifically.

### Note
I wrote those summaries hurry, so if you find any language mistakes, please don't hate me, I'm an Arabic speaker and try so hard to improve my English, thanks for your understanding : )
